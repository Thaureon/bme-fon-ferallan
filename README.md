# BME-FON-Ferallan

**BME-FON-Ferallan** is a learning-focused project within the
**Before Month's End - Finished Or Not (BME-FON)** series.

This project followed a monthly, time-boxed format. Each BME-FON project
began on the **first day of the month** and concluded on the
**last day of the month**, regardless of completion state.

For this iteration, the project ran from:

📅 **December 1, 2025 → December 31, 2025**

---

## Project Intent

This repository served as an exploration of **C# MAUI**, with a focus on
understanding core application structure, navigation patterns, and
cross-platform considerations.

Rather than targeting a single polished application, the goal of this
project was to experiment with MAUI concepts, identify friction points,
and build familiarity with common workflows and limitations.

---

## Areas of Exploration

Areas explored during this project included:

* **Basic MAUI setup**

  * Project creation and configuration
  * Understanding platform targets and build output
* **Navigation styles in MAUI**

  * Page-based navigation
  * Stack and shell-based navigation concepts
* **UI interaction patterns**

  * Communication between XAML pages and C# code-behind
* **API communication**

  * Making basic API calls
  * Initial exploration of simple security-related communication
* **Ad integration**

  * Investigation into various ad packages and setup requirements
  * Exploration remained incomplete due to build issues introduced during
    package installation

The focus throughout was on learning workflows and identifying practical
constraints rather than delivering production-ready features.

## BME-FON Philosophy

This project followed the **Finished Or Not** approach:

* Time-boxed learning
* Progress over perfection
* Iteration over abandonment

The repository reflects learning in motion rather than a finalized product.

---

## 🏁 Project Outcome

This project concluded on **December 31, 2025** as part of the BME-FON series.

Over the course of the month, the project provided hands-on exposure to
C# MAUI fundamentals, including application setup, navigation approaches,
and cross-platform considerations. While some exploratory areas—such as
ad integration—remained incomplete due to tooling and build constraints,
the project successfully surfaced key challenges and learning points
associated with MAUI development.
